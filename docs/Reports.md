#Introduction

Reports serve as the culmination of each analysis where all plots and insights generated are added in a way that is easy to understand and draw conclusions from when shared with collaborators or even used as a point of reference for something done earlier. Presence of reports for each analysis ordered sequentially promotes reproducibility across the laboratory or the organization and reduces the manual labor involved in knowledge transfer. 

To ensure that you do not spend a lot of time in downloading plots and arranging them in a pre-defined order with the insights generated each time for a study, we have built One Click Report (OCR), functionality that allows you to generate reports in a standardized format.

#Customization

The major advantage with our implementation is customization and ease of use. With our framework, we can implement an OCR for you on the app of your choice within *1 week*. You can customize the structure of the report, any text to be included and the plots themselves. Plots not on the app can be added as well as the existing plots modified according to your requirements. 

#Polly

Currently, custom OCR is integrated in the following apps:
