#Introduction

##Overview

CRISPR-Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) is one of the most popular gene-editing techniques to modify gene loci at the desired position in a model organism. The gene-editing CRISPR/cas9 method cuts at specific locations of a  DNA with the help of a small stretch of guide RNAs that takes the Cas9 endonuclease to a specific site. Increasingly the scientific groups are applying this technology to create genetic screens in order to identify mutations that drive treatment resistance to cancer or rapidly access the drug targets.  The aim of the genome-wide CRISPR screening experiment is to screen mutant cells to identify genes involved in a particular phenotype. The beauty of the pooled screen is to integrate many genetic perturbations in one experiment. The CRISPR/cas9 system begins by generating a library of perturbed cells using the library of gRNAs. Lentivirus or Retrovirus is used to deliver gRNAs i.e. integrated to the genome of the cell and serve as a molecular tag. After that cells are separated according to the phenotype of interest and the genes causing the phenotype change can be read out by first isolating the genomic DNA from the population of the cell using PCR followed by sequencing(NGS) across gRNA encoding regions. Then computationally sequencing read count is mapped to a precompiled list of the designed gRNA library. 

**How does CRISPR screening help scientists find gene targets?**

CRISPR-Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) is one of the most popular gene-editing techniques to modify gene loci at the desired position in a model organism. CRISPR technique is extremely helpful in the identification of genes involved in a particular biological phenomenon. The two main components of CRISPR screening are Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9) and specific guide RNAs that either disrupt host gene or insert gene fragments of interest. Bacteria use this system as a part of their adaptive immune response. Cas9 is an enzyme involved in this mechanism and sgRNA is the complementary sequence of foreign DNA. The popularity of CRISPR-Cas9 is also influenced by its simplicity and cost-effectiveness.
